# About
Hi everyone. I commute on the Washington, D.C. beltway to and from work almost every day. So, the determining factor on when I go home is when the worst drivers in America decide to stop driving for the day. To find this out,  I find myself checking Google Maps constantly to see when my commute drops below an hour.

The purpose of this project was to prevent me from continuously doing that, as well as to learn a little bit more about Microsoft Azure, Powershell, Google Maps, Google Cloud Platform, and APIs in general.
